<h1>Key Projects</h1>

<h2>Pepboys.com</h2>

<p>I was one of the original developers/architects that built <a href="http://www.pepboys.com/">pepboys.com</a> ecommerce website.  I designed and built the <a href="http://www.pepboys.com/">pepboys.com</a> order management system that processes all web orders for their ecommerce website.  The system handles ~1000 orders/day and process over $100k/day in transactions. I also built account management, account registration, store geolocation, and appointment scheduling modules.</p>

<h2>JCPenney Product Master Data Management</h2>

<p>I led a 14 developer team that built JCPenney&#39;s Item Master Data Management System.  My team built a front end web application used by JCPenney merchandising associates to catalog retail products for sale online and in stores.  The backend system was built using a service-oriented architecture that provided services and data to enterprise systems. </p>

<h2>Global Payments Lead Referral Application</h2>

<p>I led a 3 person team that built a lead referral application for GlobalPayments.  The application was used by affiliate partners to capture and submit leads to GlobalPayment’s sales associates.  The front end was a multi-tenant web application that captured and tracked leads.  The backend integrated with GlobalPayment’s CRM to track a lead through its lifecycle.  The system was able to managed several thousand leads at a time.  The application generated additional revenue for GlobalPayments and its affiliate partners and simplified the lead referral process.</p>

<h2>Manheim Auctions Consignor Portals</h2>

<p>I led a 5 person team that built custom portal websites for Manheim’s customers.  The websites were used by automobile manufacturers to showcase vehicles available for auction.  My team built a website framework using Plumtree/Oracle Portal technology which made it possible for business users to build custom websites.  As a result Manheim was able to rollout turnkey websites with very short development cycles. </p>
